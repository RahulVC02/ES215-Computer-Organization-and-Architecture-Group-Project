# ES215-Computer-Organization-and-Architecture-Group-Project
This repository contains the source files for the ES215 Course Project. As part of this project, we built a MIPS Assembler and Disassembler Program in Python. We also built a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for this program using Python's Tkinter library. The team consisted of Bhavesh Jain, Chirag Sarda, Dhruv Parekh and myself.


#How to Test?

The attached report contains the Data Card/instructions supported by our program. The GUI will open a textbox for both- the Assembler and the Disassembler.
Simply write any program (in the supported instructions)- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the Machine Code.
To use the Disassembler, type in the Machine Code- line by line- in the input textbox and press Convert to obtain the MIPS Code.
