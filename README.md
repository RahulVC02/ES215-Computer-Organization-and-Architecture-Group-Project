# ES215-Computer-Organization-and-Architecture-Group-Project
This repository contains the source files for the ES215 Course Project. As part of this project, we built a MIPS Assembler and Disassembler Program in Python. We also built a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for this program using Python's Tkinter library. The team consisted of Bhavesh Jain, Chirag Sarda and Dhruv Parekh.
